###Problem Description

Abdullah is a freedom fighter, fighting against the occupant forces. As a part of his fighting strategy, his primary target
is the destruction of railroads.
In this problem, the task is to assist Abdullah to make best use of his limited resources. He has some information
available from intelligence wing of his organization. First, the rail line is completely linear which means that there are
no branches, no spurs. Next, the Intelligence wing has assigned a Strategic Importance to each depot which is an integer
from 1 to 5. Moreover, a depot is of no use on its own, it only has value if it is connected to other depots. The Strategic
Value of the entire railroad is calculated by adding up the products of the Strategic Values for every pair of depots that
are connected, directly or indirectly, by the rail line. Consider the following railroad:

The strategic value of above railroad is computed as: 4*5 + 4*1 + 4*2 + 5*1 + 5*2 + 1*2 = 49.
Now, suppose that Abdullah only has enough resources for one attack. He cannot attack the depots themselves because
they are too well defended. He must attack the rail line between depots, in the middle of the desert. Consider what
would happen if Abdullah attacked this rail line right in the middle:

The Strategic Value of the remaining railroad is 4*5 + 1*2 = 22. But, suppose Abdullah attacks between the 4 and 5
depots:

The Strategic Value of the remaining railroad is 5*1 + 5*2 + 1*2 = 17. This is the Abdullah's best option.
Given a description of a railroad and the number of attacks that Abdullah can perform, figure out the smallest Strategic
Value that he can achieve for that railroad.
Input
There will be several data sets. Each data set will begin with a line with two integers, n and m. n is the number of depots
on the railroad (1≤n≤1000), and m is the number of attacks Abdullah has resources for (0≤m<n). On the next line will be
n integers, each from 1 to 5, indicating the Strategic Value of each depot in order. End of input will be marked by a line
with n=0 and m=0, which should not be processed.
Output
For each data set, output a single integer, indicating the smallest Strategic Value for the railroad that Abdullah can
achieve with his attacks. Output each integer in its own line.
