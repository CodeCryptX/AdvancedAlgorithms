Each type of structure should consist of 2 or more stages. Each stage consists of a natural number of blocks. No two
stages are allowed to be at the same height. Each stage must be lower in height than the previous one. All stages must
contain at least one block. The height of a stage is defined by the number of blocks that make up that stage.
For example, when N = 3, you have only 1 choice of how to build the structure, with the first stage having a height of 2
and the second step having a height of 1 as follows:
ğŸ“¦
ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦
2  1
When N = 4, you still only have 1 structure choice:
ğŸ“¦
ğŸ“¦
ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦
3  1
But when N = 5, there are two ways you can build a structure from the given blocks.
The two staircases can have heights (4, 1) or (3, 2), as shown below:
ğŸ“¦
ğŸ“¦
ğŸ“¦
ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦
4  1
ğŸ“¦
ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦
ğŸ“¦ğŸ“¦
3  2
Write a C++/Java/Python program that takes a positive integer n and returns the number of different number of
structures that can be built from exactly n blocks, where 3 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 200.
