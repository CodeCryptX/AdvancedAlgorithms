In the world of solo leveling, a new S class Gate has emerged, attracting the attention of Laiba. With excitement, Laiba
decides to host a rigorous training session for Hunters. A total of M*N hunters arrive at Laiba's session, forming M rows
of equal size, each containing exactly n individuals. The adventurers are numbered from 1 to n in each row, following
the order from left to right.
Eager to assemble an unbeatable team, Laiba plans to select members with a strategic approach. The selection process
involves choosing adventurers from left to right, ensuring that the column index of each chosen member (excluding the
first column) is strictly greater than the column index of the previously chosen hunter. To maintain fairness and balance,
Laiba aims to avoid consecutive selections from the same row. The first hunter can be chosen from any of the M * N
participants without any additional constraints. The team can accommodate no more than N members.
You are provided with the power level of each hunter, write an optimal solution of complexity O(N*M) that calculates
the maximum power that the newly arranged team can have.
